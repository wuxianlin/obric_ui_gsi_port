    <p>Important: Before deactivating your account, please carefully read, understand, and agree to the following matters:</p>
    <p><strong>Special Notice: Account deactivation is an irreversible operation. Except for information you have authorized to be provided to third parties, after deactivating your account, you will no longer be able to use this ChunTian ZhiYun Unified Account, nor retrieve any content or information you created, entered, browsed, followed, added, or linked (even if you re-register and use the product with the same mobile number).</strong></p>
    <p>ChunTian ZhiYun Account Service ("Unified Account Service") refers to the unified account service we (<strong>Beijing ChunTian ZhiYun Technology Co., Ltd.</strong>) provide to you through multiple functionally integrated associated products. Such associated products include DouBao, KouZi, etc. To ensure a consistent service experience and interconnection between associated products, these products use the ChunTian ZhiYun Unified Account Service to collectively collect and process your account information (e.g., nickname and ID). Your account registered or logged into KouZi will also serve as a universal identifier for the Unified Account Service, allowing you to synchronously log in to and use associated products and access related services.</p>
    <p>A Unified Account is a credential created by you in accordance with the User Agreement of ChunTian ZhiYun's associated products (including DouBao, KouZi, MaoXiang, XingHui, etc.), which you use to log in and access associated products and services as a registered user.</p>
    <p>Please ensure that the Unified Account you apply to deactivate is an account created by you in accordance with the User Agreement and provided to you by us. You should deactivate the account through the procedures we specify or as prompted on our website.</p>
    <p>Before deactivating your account, you should back up all account-related information and data and confirm that all services associated with the account have been properly handled. After deactivation, we will delete your personal information or anonymize it (unless otherwise required by laws and regulations).</p>
    <p>We regret your decision to deactivate the account. If you still decide to proceed, your account must meet the following conditions simultaneously:</p>
    <p>Please ensure that the product account you apply to deactivate is one created by you in accordance with the User Agreement, and you have the right to apply for deactivation. If your deactivation operation affects the legitimate rights and interests of any third party, you shall bear legal responsibility yourself.</p>
