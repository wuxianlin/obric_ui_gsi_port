        <p>Welcome to apply for using the products and services we provide.</p>
        <p>We provide services to you through multiple closely integrated related products, including DouBao, Kouzi, Mao Box, Xinghui, and DouBao Aixue.</p>
        <p>To ensure a consistent service experience across the above-related products and guarantee interconnection between products, these related products use a unified account service to collectively collect and process your account information within the above products, which may include: <strong>account profile information such as nickname, avatar, and mobile phone number</strong>. You can also take the initiative to perform other interactive operations, such as using Kouzi to edit the intelligent agents you created in DouBao.</p>
        <p>The account you register for this product will simultaneously serve as a universal identifier for the unified account service, allowing you to log in to and use all the above-related products synchronously to access relevant services without needing to re-register separately. The binding relationship between this account and third-party accounts, the account's penalty status, etc., will also remain linked under the unified account service.
