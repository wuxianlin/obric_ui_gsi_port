    Beijing Chuntian Zhiyun Technology Co., Ltd. ("we" or "Chuntian") understands the importance of your personal information. Your trust is vital to us. We protect your personal information and privacy in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and with reference to industry best practices. We have formulated this Privacy Policy and remind you to read and understand it carefully before using nubia M153 and related services so you can make an informed choice.</p>
<p><strong>About this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile devices, websites, and applications of nubia M153 that reference or link to this Policy (collectively, "Products and Services"). If a specific Product or Service has its own privacy policy or statement (an "Independent Policy"), that Independent Policy will take precedence; for matters not expressly covered in an Independent Policy, this Privacy Policy will apply supplementally. If there is any conflict between the Independent Policy and this Privacy Policy, the Independent Policy prevails.</p>
<p>
    If you use services provided by our affiliated companies that have their own privacy policies, those services or products are governed by the corresponding privacy policies.</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, process, and protect personal information that you authorize us to provide or that we collect proactively. We follow this Privacy Policy when collecting and using your information and will not bundle or mandatorily collect personal information solely because you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
    Due to differences in your device model, service version, and other factors, specific Products or Services may differ in how they collect and process your personal information.</p>
<p>
    When you enable certain features or use certain services, we collect and use the necessary information to provide those features and services. Unless the information is necessary to realize the business function or is required by law or regulation, you may refuse to provide it without affecting other features or services. We specify, item by item, the information to be collected in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
    The following sections help you understand how we collect, use, store, transfer (where applicable), and protect personal information; and how you can access, copy, correct, delete, and withdraw authorization for your personal information. This Policy is closely related to your use of our services. We recommend that you read and understand the entire Policy and make appropriate choices. <strong>We highlight important content related to your personal information rights in bold; please pay special attention.</strong>
