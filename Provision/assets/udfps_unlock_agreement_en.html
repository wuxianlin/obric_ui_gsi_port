<p>Welcome to use the fingerprint unlocking screen feature.</p>
<p><strong>About this feature:</strong></p>
<p>Audio fingerprint recognition is a technology that identifies a
    person's identity based on their fingerprint characteristic information.
    This technology captures the user's fingerprint data through the
    built-in fingerprint sensor in the mobile phone (such as under-screen
    optical fingerprint, under-screen ultrasonic fingerprint, etc.) and
    compares it with the pre-registered fingerprint characteristics, thereby
    achieving audio fingerprint recognition and identity verification. Audio
    fingerprint recognition can be used to unlock the device screen.</p>
<p><strong>Precautions:</strong></p>
<p>Fingerprint can be used to unlock devices easily, but its security
    may be less reliable than that of complex passwords, pattern passwords,
    or numeric passwords.</p>
<p>Since you leave fingerprints when touching objects, others may use
    your fingerprints to unlock this device after replicating them. Do not
    casually hand over the device to others to prevent the audio fingerprint
    recognition function from being maliciously exploited.</p>
<p><strong>Data Privacy Statement for Audio Fingerprint Recognition
    Unlock Function:</strong></p>
<p>Your fingerprint data, including the mathematical representation of
    your fingerprint, will be strictly protected and encrypted for storage
    in a secure isolated area of this device. We will not back up your
    fingerprint data, and other applications will not be able to access or
    back up your fingerprint data. Fingerprint data is not stored in image
    form but exists in the form of a mathematical representation, and no one
    can obtain your original fingerprint image. In addition, fingerprint
    data will be continuously updated as you use the fingerprint unlocking
    function to improve your experience and enhance security.</p>
<p>You have the authority to manage independently and can control the
    scope of use of audio fingerprint recognition by yourself. For example,
    you can go to ["System Settings" &gt; "Password &amp; Security" &gt;
    "Password Settings" &gt; "Lock Screen Password"] to set the lock screen
    password method and turn off the function of unlocking the screen with
    audio fingerprint recognition.</p>
<p>You can also manage your fingerprint information (including enrolling
    new fingerprints and deleting the fingerprint data you have already
    enrolled) via &lt;"System Settings" &gt; "Password &amp; Security" &gt;
    "Fingerprint Information Management"&gt;. Once deleted, the relevant
    data will be immediately cleared from the device. If you have not
    enrolled any fingerprints or refuse to provide fingerprint information,
    the fingerprint unlock function will be unavailable.</p>
