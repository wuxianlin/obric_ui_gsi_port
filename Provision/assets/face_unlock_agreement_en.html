<p>Welcome to use the facial unlock screen feature.</p>
<p><strong>About this feature:</strong></p>
<p>Facial recognition is a technology that identifies a person's
    identity based on facial feature information. This technology captures
    multiple frames of images in real time through the front-facing camera
    of a mobile phone, ultimately forming a set of facial feature data as
    reference data. When you perform facial unlocking, this function will
    compare real-time facial feature data, thereby quickly completing the
    comparison and identity authentication, which can be used to unlock the
    screen. Accordingly, we need to apply for and call the front-facing
    camera permission of the device to capture facial data.</p>
<p><strong>Precautions for enabling facial unlock function:</strong></p>
<p>Your device may be unlocked by someone with a similar appearance to
    you. Do not casually hand your device over to others to prevent this
    feature from being maliciously exploited;</p>
<p>The security of facial unlock is lower than that of pattern
    passwords, numeric passwords, and complex passwords;</p>
<p>When entering facial data, avoid the following personal states, such
    as wearing sunglasses, hats, masks, having a beard, or wearing heavy
    makeup;</p>
<p>Avoid entering information in dimly lit environments, prevent the
    camera lens from getting dirty, and ensure the headshot is clear and
    easily recognizable to increase the probability of successful
    matching.</p>
<p><strong>Data Privacy Statement for Facial Unlock
    Function:</strong></p>
<p>Your facial data will be strictly protected and encrypted, stored in
    a secure isolated area of this device. We will not back up your facial
    data, and other applications will not be able to access or back up your
    facial data either.</p>
<p>You have autonomous management permissions, and you can control the
    scope of use of facial recognition on your own. For example, you can
    turn off the facial unlock screen feature, which can be turned off
    in[fill in the path to turn off facial recognition here].</p>
<p>You can also delete your registered facial data via [the path to
    delete facial data goes here]. Once deleted, the device will no longer
    store your facial information, and related functions will become
    unavailable.</p>
