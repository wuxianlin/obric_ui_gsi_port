<p>The System Account service is provided to you by Beijing Chuntian Zhiyun Technology Co., Ltd. and its affiliates ("we" or "Chuntian"). We attach great importance to your personal information and privacy. We process your personal information within a reasonably necessary scope in accordance with legal requirements and mature industry security standards and provide appropriate security protection measures.</p>
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy is an important part of the nubia M153 <a href="myapp://click?type=privacy_agreement"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a>. It contains special terms related to this service. In case of inconsistencies, this Privacy Policy prevails; for matters not covered herein, the nubia M153 <a href="myapp://click?type=privacy_agreement" ><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a> applies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. How we collect and process your personal information</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1 Registration and login</strong></p>
<p>a. When you register, log in to the system account, bind a device, or retrieve your account password, we collect the necessary information you provide to create or verify the account, including your mobile number, system account name, and password. You may also choose to supplement other account information (e.g., nickname, avatar) for personalized display. The above information is used solely for system account identification, display, and authentication.</p>
<p>b. Unless otherwise specified, Doubao’s associated products use a unified account service. The system account you register serves as a unified credential, enabling synchronized login and use of Doubao and its associated products without separate re-registration. The binding between this system account and third-party accounts, and account penalties, are also linked under the unified account service. See <a
        href="myapp://click?type=unified_account_agreement">Learn about the unified account service system</a> for the scope of associated products.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Cloud services</strong></p>
<p><strong>a. Data sync</strong></p>
<p>After you enable Cloud Services, you can choose whether to sync specific types of local data (such as Contacts/Address Book, Notes, and Browser). Each data sync requires your authorization and can be disabled at any time in system settings. Once enabled, we will sync the following data according to your settings:</p>
<p>Contacts/Address Book data (such as contact name, mobile number, email, nickname, notes, avatar, and other contact information you actively provide)</p>
<p>Notes data (such as text, images, audio, and other note content you actively edit)</p>
<p>Browser data (such as browser bookmarks)</p>
<p>We use encryption technologies, security protections, and access control mechanisms not lower than industry standards to protect your cloud data from unauthorized access and malicious attacks and conduct regular security audits to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong>b. Cloud management</strong></p>
<p>You can view your cloud storage usage or manage your cloud data via [Settings > System Account > Cloud Services]. To realize these functions, we collect and display statistics such as total storage capacity, used and remaining space, and storage distribution.</p>

<p>To realize these functions, we may need to collect your device information (unique device identifiers IMEI/IMSI), location information (GPS positioning), and Bluetooth status information (such as Bluetooth name) to perform device location and send control commands to the device.</p>
